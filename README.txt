Roller Kings featuring Randy the Red King
by Ethan MacGregor

Roller Kings is a traditional-ish fighting game featuring a unique rolling mechanic.

To play Roller Kings, you must simply type "make vba" in the command prompt in the directory you installed the .zip in, or simply use an emulator that can understand ROMs and feed it "RollerKings.gba" in the appropriate place. 

In Roller Kings, you control the Yellow King, ruler of the Yellow Kingdom, a resourceful but weak man. Your opponent is Randy the Red King, ruler of the Red Kingdom. While, the Yellow King is a physical manifestation of you (except in this version of reality you are a stick figure with a yellow crown), the Red King is an entity unto himself. I'll let you in on a dirty secret: Randy the Red King is called that because his choices and actions are entirely random. But, even though Randy is a complete moron, he is much faster and much stronger than you are. (Meaning he has a higher max speed than you and much more health.) It's a David vs Goliath situation, and you must use your superior intellect to defeat Randy.

Tips and tricks!

When you are rolling, you cannot attack or be attacked, but you use up energy every frame you are rolling. If you know fighting games well, you might consider rolling to be a spiritual equivalent to shielding, traditional rolling, and crouching all in one.

Anytime you are not rolling or attacking you regain energy.

Anytime you attack you lose half of your energy bar.

Anytime you use a hadouken you lose a quarter of your energy bar

Always fire a hadouken at the top of your jump, because it will hit someone at any possible height.

You can only have one hadouken active at a time.

A hadouken does 2/5 the damage of a punch

The Red King has exactly five times as much health as you do. Each time you punch him he will lose 1/10 of his health but everytime he punches you you will lose 1/2 of your health. So be careful! (Hadoukens will do 1/25 damage and 1/5 damage respectively)

Thoughts: 
While the health difference is daunting, in my experience the game is not as difficult as it might seem. Make sure you wail hard on him when you have the energy to do so and then get the hell away from him when you don't. Anytime you see a hadouken coming your way you should roll immediately. If you are right next to him he can sent hadoukens right at you that you will have no room or time to dodge. If you want to win you just need to remember what he is: a random number generator.

I would love to make this game twoplayer if the gameboy had enough buttons to provide for such a thing because I am actually somewhat intrigued by this rolling system I've invented, but sadly we are stuck with Randy.
